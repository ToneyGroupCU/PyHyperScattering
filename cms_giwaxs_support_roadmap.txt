Plans for establishing CMS time resolved GIWAXS support in phs:

1. Write file loading class / script and successfully load raw TIFFs into xarrays, need:
    - A loadSingleImage method, this will get pulled into the loadFileSeries method of the FileLoader parent class for actual useage
    - A loadMd method to gather metadata
2. Write functions to perform data corrections & reductions
    - For now build these into GIWAXS.py script, but maybe work into PFGeneralIntegrator?
3. Work on robustly loading in metadata
